It’s important that NavCoin community members are able to contribute to projects and confidently use the range of features that are built into the NavCoin ecosystem. The easier it is, allows for a wider range of people to contribute to the NavCoin ecosystem.

It’s important that NavCoin community members are able to contribute to projects and confidently use the range of features that are built into the NavCoin ecosystem. The easier it is to contribute, the stronger the NavCoin ecosystem becomes. With that in mind NavCoin Core developers have committed to adding content regularly to the Knowledge Base on NavCoin.org and on social media.  

As well as adding release notes to Github as usual they will also be writing detailed articles and posts on the projects they’re working on, and submitting them to the navhub.org news section. The idea is that by having more resources, the community can increase their understanding of how blockchain software and applications work, and as a result will feel empowered to contribute to, and originate, community initiatives. 

If you haven’t already seen the information and resources that are available at the NavCoin Knowledge Base check it out here:

### Developer Updates

Testing is a vital part of building a secure and reliable ecosystem for NavCoin. So following on from the large amount of coding work that’s been covered in recent issues of Community News, testing has been taking the lion’s share of core developers’ time.

- The Community Fund and NAV OpenAlias functionality in NavCoin Core. 
- Testing and documenting the optimal approach for resolving NavPi memory issues.

To go along with their work on NavPi, Core developers have written a new Knowledge Base article aimed at remedying its performance issues. You can view it here:

If you need additional help check out the ‘#navpi-support’ channel on Discord. Here’s your invitation to the channel if you haven't joined already:

Remember that anyone can get involved in testing too. Head over to GitHub to familiarise yourself with the development platform and see what’s going on. There could be a Pull Request you could review or a new version of NavCoin software to download, run, and comment on.

Other developer efforts over the past week have been creating a new image for the NavPi, and continuing to build the new NAV OpenAlias website.

### Core Content Creators

The Core Content Creators have been occupied with building a solid foundation of information for the upcoming Community Fund. Once it’s complete you will have all you need to know to submit a well planned proposal. There will be extra material available on NavHub.org and Navcoin.org and the upcoming Collab website. This new resource for community members is intended to help make building a team around your project easier and more productive.


That’s all for this week,

NavCoin Core
