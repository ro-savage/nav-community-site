Over the past week finding ways to increase participation in NavCoin Core feature testing has been a hot topic among NavCoin Core Developers. It’s important that as many people as possible take part in testing release candidates and software fixes. Not only does it make the NavCoin ecosystem more robust, it also provides the perfect opportunity to learn more about blockchain and how it works. The Core developers sincerely appreciate the assistance of the people in the global NavCoin community who already help out consistently, but there’s always opportunity for more people to come on board and enhance their technology skills.

Over the past week finding ways to increase participation by the community in NavCoin Core feature testing has been a hot topic among NavCoin Core Developers.

The Core developers sincerely appreciate the assistance of the people in the global NavCoin community who already help out consistently, but there’s always opportunity for more people to come on board and enhance their technology skills.

Despite what some people think, testing is not all about checking endless lines of code. It can be as simple as downloading the latest release candidate wallet, making sure it works properly, and then leaving your feedback as a comment in GitHub. Every piece of feedback goes a long way in helping the developers make better software.

If you’re not sure how to get started, Discord is a great place to go. There you’ll find many other community members who’re only too happy to share their experience and give you helpful advice.

### Developer Updates

Improving the stability of NavPi devices has been a key focus for Core developers over the past week. Now that solutions have been worked out, documenting them is next on the list. Articles for the NavCoin Knowledge Base and updates to the NavPi documentation on GitHub are in the works, and a new NavPi page for the Community Hub website is almost ready to go. When testing is complete they will be released to the wider NavCoin community.  

As always a lot of effort is going into developing the Community Fund. This week it’s been testing ways to optimize developer workflow across platforms. Alongside that, progress has been quick on the NAV OpenAlias website, and it’s hoped to have that ready to go soon. Please remember that once the NavCoin Core wallet 4.3.0 has been approved for release, you will need to remember to download it to access the new NAV OpenAlias feature.

### Core Content Creators

Designs and content for the NAV OpenAlias registration website mentioned above are well underway. The new site outlines the benefits of using OpenAlias and guides you through generating your own alias. This will be published soon, but in the meantime check out the OpenAlias.org website to see why it will be a worthwhile addition to the resources offered in the NavCoin community.

Work has also progressed on a new collaboration website that is being created to make it much easier for the community to find and collaborate on community projects. A lot of this collaboration currently happens informally through our social channels - but the aim is to create a space that anyone can visit, view the different projects being worked on and find out how they can get involved. There will be more information on this resource once the Community Fund gets closer to launching. 

On a side note to that, almost 10,000 NAV has already accumulated in the Community Fund. Have you started thinking about projects you might like to propose for funding?


### Top Community News
 
The NavCoin Twitter account is approaching 50,000 followers. It’s great to be part of such a large community which has members engaging in it from all over the world. It’s also good to see that NavCoin’s Reddit channel is busy too with plenty of activity over the past week, and almost 12,000 people subscribed to the NavCoin subreddit.

That’s all for this week,
