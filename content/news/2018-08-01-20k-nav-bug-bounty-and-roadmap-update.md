The big news this week was the announcement of the Community Fund Bug Bounty programme. Up to 20,000 NAV is available as an incentive to try and break the fund. Payment will be on a sliding scale depending on the severity of the bug identified. The Community Fund is live on the testnet now, so why not head over to GitHub and do your best to hack it.

At the time of writing almost 20,000 NAV had accumulated in the Fund. Over a full year 250,000 NAV will go into the Fund to pay for community projects, so the core developers want to make absolutely sure it’s secure. To check the latest balance visit the Fund address on the Nav Explorer.

A video tutorial is in the works that demonstrates how to test the Community Fund and search for bugs. Keep an eye out for it on the social channels.

### Developer Updates

This week the focus was on wrapping up the NavPi memory fix issues, including the release of new Knowledge Base articles and an updated NavPi image (v1.0.9). You can view the full article about the NavPi fix here:

Core developers and community devs have been testing the final stages of NAV OpenAlias for the upcoming NavCoin Core 4.3.0 release. This is a feature release with no fork required, so a consensus vote isn’t necessary before this update is merged with the mainnet.

If you looked at the roadmap in the past few days you might have noticed that the Community Fund, Cold Staking and NAV OpenAlias have been shifted to a new category called ‘Beta Testing.’ This update was made to avoid confusion that’s been cropping up because the roadmap was showing these projects at 90% - but actually they have been built, and are either awaiting testing or currently being tested.

### Core Content Creators

Over the past week Core Content Creators continued their work on building resources to support the launch of NAV OpenAlias and the Community Fund. They also worked with Core devs to get the word out to the community, appealing for more people to get involved in testing the Community Fund in Github. If you haven’t already taken a look at GitHub you can see what’s going on here.

Work has also begun on refreshing the NavCoin static websites. There has been a lot of new content added over the last 3-5 months, including the creation of the navhub.org community website. So now it's time to take a step back and assess the overall user experience. This work includes reviewing where each page sits in the overall sitemap, the way pages are formatted, and whether the navigation allows content to be found easily, and where visitors expect to find it.

That’s all for this week,

NavCoin Core
