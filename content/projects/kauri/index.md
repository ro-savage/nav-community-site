        <p>The first stage of the project is to build Kauri as a cross-platform thin client which supports NAV, BTC and ETH. At this point the wallet will be able to generate, encrypt and restore private keys as well as send and receive transactions.</p>
        <p>This creates a solid foundation for the additional features and functionality outlined here which we will then iteratively implement into the wallet.</p>
